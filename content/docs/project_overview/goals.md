<br>

**The hexaROCKET project has the following goal(s)** [as of January 2023]:

1. **Launch a rocket that can reach an altitude of 3,000 meters**

<br>

Although the project goals can be completed in many ways, successful execution of the following steps would constitute a successful mission:

1. Setup a launch apparatus to guide the rocket toward the sky (and not the ground)
2. Ignite the rocket motor (safely)
3. Record 
    - minimally: altimeter data
    - optimally: all in-flight sensor data
    - additionally: real-time in-flight telemetry transmission, recieving, and displaying system preferred 
4. After reaching maximum altitude and on downward descent, deploy a parachute to protect the rocket from sudden and violent impact with the earth
5. Transmit a recovery signal so that the rocket may be found more easily
6. Recover recorded flight data from the hardware storage after flight.

Each of the above steps must be successfully executed in order for the overall project to be considered a success
