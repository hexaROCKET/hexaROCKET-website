## Introduction

The [goal](../goals/) of this project is to develop a rocket that can reach 3,000 metres of altitude.
To accomplish this task several systems need to be developed, including:

1. [Avionics](../../avionics/overview/) - The computer software and hardware that will control the rocket throughout its flight
2. [Airframe](../../airframe/overview/) - The structure of the rocket
1. [Propulsion](../../propulsion/overview/) - The system that will get the rocket moving.

These systems are continually being developed, as discussed in our project [roadmap](../roadmap/).

## Motivation

This is a student/hobby project. As such the main motivating factor is to learn. Avionics will be the initial focus, as 
collecting flight data successfully is essential for iterating and improving on other aspects of the overall project.
